By observing how the AI’s predictions on the abundances of exoplanet molecules changed (say water in the atmosphere) when each region was doctored, they started to build a “picture” of how the AI thought, such as which regions of the spectrum it used for deciding the level of water in the atmosphere. This finding provided the first method to have a sneaky peek into so-called “AI black-boxes”, allowing us to evaluate what the AIs have learnt. With these tools, researchers now can not only use AIs to speed up their analysis of exo-atmospheres, but they can also verify that their AI uses well-understood laws of nature.\n\n"},{"href":"https://theconversation.com/ai-can-reliably-spot-molecules-on-exoplanets-and-might-one-day-even-discover-new-laws-of-physics-172701","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Read more!"}],"openInNewTab":false},{"text":""}]}]}},"categories":[{"name":"News","slug":"news"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
