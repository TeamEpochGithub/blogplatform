It will affect most of our lives in some way in the near future. It’s no surprise that the development of this field is supported via the help of computers, particularly through methods of artificial intelligence. But it’s also important to note that finding feasible and effective solutions through artificial intelligence is not an easy task of its own.

As an incentive, most competitions have prize systems not only limited to money but also things such as redeemable money, access to software and exposure through different means. The nature of a competition is much different than what a paid worker is doing to tackle the issue in an organizational structure which creates the main difference of the problem-solution path from what we usually come across. It invites people that are actually interested in the topic as well as to keep the competitive nature, which in return induces creative developments and state-of-the-art approaches to issues that haven’t been named before. Important to note is that the competition itself is not the goal but rather a means to an end, as the desired outcome of the competition is to bring people together for one cause and pursue the further development of the solutions that were created. "}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"The competitions mostly take place in competition platforms such as Kaggle, DrivenData or AICrowd. These platforms have an agreement with companies that want to host these competitions. These companies provide the resources for the hosting of the competition such as the prize pool, existing documentation and raw/processed data for the competitors if possible. A key part of most AI competitions is the fact that collaboration is not only recommended but also preferred, mostly through the hosting platform’s discussion or notebook section. This allows people to communicate with others to tackle known obstacles to save time and effort, as well as to push each other’s knowledge further by motivating and getting feedback in the meantime. At the same time, some solutions influence other people’s way of thinking and even can lead up to unconventional and creative approaches. "}]},{"src":"https://media.graphcms.com/59kFdVxxQD2WTxIwa0Ho","type":"image","title":"ai-solutions-how-artificial-intelligence-powers-business-header.png","width":945,"handle":"59kFdVxxQD2WTxIwa0Ho","height":523,"children":[{"text":""}],"mimeType":"image/png"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/resources/how-does-artificial-intelligence-work/","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Source","italic":true}],"openInNewTab":false},{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Although the practices, algorithms, approaches to AI, and winning strategies change a lot from competition to competition, an established cycle for the contest is always there.

Since 2017, the NFL is even providing this data to the teams so that they could analyze the plays of their players within an equal framework. What the NFL wanted in this competition was to be able to predict how far players actually can go from the data available at the time the ball carrier picks up the ball.

This allows the algorithm to adjust and train itself. For the competition it is also specified which method of evaluation will be used for means of transparency and clarification of performance.
