Our team currently consists of 16 \n      motivated students with different study backgrounds and skills ranging from Computer Science to Technology,\n       Policy and Management. Because of these diverse skill sets, we are confident in our ability to succeed.\n       Team Epoch competes simultaneously in multiple competitions with different \n         fields such as healthcare, transportation, sports, or business. By having a broad range of topics for the \n         competitions,our team will thrive with well-trained and well-rounded AI engineers by the end of the year.\n         By enabling students with various backgrounds to compete \n         in AI competitions we aim to actively contribute to democratizing AI. We believe in good AI and that for the future of AI \n         accessibility to AI knowledge is crucial. This not only prevents monopolistic outcomes but also helps to improve the \n         development of AI in the right direction: as a positive and useful solution to societal problems."},{title:"What do we do?",content:"The AI competitions that we compete in are in the field of data science. \n        The idea of these competitions is that as long as you have access to a computer and the internet, you can participate. \n        The organizers of the competition usually provide a large dataset and the objective of the challenge.\n        This is a real-life problem for which most of the time a guideline for the solution already exists, called the 'baseline'.\n        The goal of the competition is to surpass the baseline and build a better-performing model. \n        Team Epoch aims to find new solutions for these competitions by combining already existing methods.\n        Which competitions we do depends on different aspects like the topic, \n         the organizers, the expected approach, the given dataset, and the scale of the competition. \n         Of course, all of these should be in line with our mission statement."},{title:"Why are we doing this?",content:"We aim to have a positive impact on the world with AI.
