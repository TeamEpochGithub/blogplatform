Although there were ups and downs within the field in the following years, it became apparent that the idea of a “supercomputer in charge of our society” was still in the distant future. Through time, the perception of AI changed in a way that it doesn’t necessarily challenge the usefulness of human intelligence but rather be used as an accelerator tool for decision making. With the shift to the digital age, the amount of data that we create has increased drastically.
