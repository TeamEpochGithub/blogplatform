In some cases, the academic perception can even change; some of the techniques that were developed by the AI researchers, only to be reclassified as Big Data algorithms(algorithms that are used to analyze large quantities of data) later on.

General AI is the notional idea of AI in the future that would be capable of showing intelligence in the full range of cognitive abilities as good as an average human. Although it’s very exciting, it looks very difficult to reach this level of AI for at least the following few decades. Narrow AI on the other hand focuses on daily problems that we come across in our lives each day.

To put it simply, Machine Learning is a way of processing a body of data with various methods to try and derive a procedure that explains the data, or even predict future data.

Deep Learning works differently than Machine Learning in a way that it mimics the human brain structure with neurons. Deep Learning networks consist of varying amounts of layers where each layer receives input values from the previous layer and transmits output values to the next layer. Thus, further connections that can’t be seen directly from the data can be found through multilateral processing of the data. With this approach, more complex and extensive patterns can be found in the given data. A very common example for this would be Apple’s Face ID technology.
