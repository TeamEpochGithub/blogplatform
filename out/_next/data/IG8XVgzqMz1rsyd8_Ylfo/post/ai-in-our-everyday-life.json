It was developed by Arthur Samuel in 1959 on the IBM 704 computer. However, as researchers continued to investigate the possible use of AI in our society, a lot of obstacles arose. In addition to the lack of enough computational power at its time, the best result was not always calculated within a reasonable timeframe. Although there were ups and downs within the field in the following years, it became apparent that the idea of a “supercomputer in charge of our society” was still in the distant future. Through time, the perception of AI changed in a way that it doesn’t necessarily challenge the usefulness of human intelligence but rather be used as an accelerator tool for decision making. With the shift to the digital age, the amount of data that we create has increased drastically. This created a demand for how this unused flow of data could be salvaged through analysis to improve efficiency in certain fields. Therefore, AI became the transition step since it doesn’t require as many resources to allocate while still keeping a level of intelligence that is usually lost through automation."}]},{"src":"https://media.graphcms.com/resize=width:600,height:457/Qqmz932QRPq7Hmj0OEei","type":"image","title":"image3.jpg","width":600,"handle":"Qqmz932QRPq7Hmj0OEei","height":457,"altText":"Creators of “Logic Theorist”, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, trying to master chess for their next computer program.","children":[{"text":""}],"mimeType":"image/jpeg"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Currently, AI has a wide range of use in today’s society.
